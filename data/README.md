This folder contains the optimized geometries reported in the Supporting Information of "A simplified time-dependent density functional theory approach for electronic ultraviolet and circular dichroism spectra of very large molecules" by C. Bannwarth and S. Grimme.

"All geometries presented here were optimized at the TPSS-D3/def2-TZVP level[1, 2,
3, 4] using the TURBOMOLE suite of programs[5, 6]. The resolution of the identity
approximation was used throughout[7, 8, 9, 10]."

Geometries are given in **a.u.**
